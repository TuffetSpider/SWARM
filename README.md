# SWARM
Turtle webhook control panel mod with autonomous reproduction and maybe later swarming/schematic building capabilities
To set up the webhook use https://github.com/PrintedScript/turtle-control
Huge thanks to MerlinLikeTheWizard, PrintedScript, and Ottomated because this is mostly just cobbled together from their work.
